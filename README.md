angular-ios7
============

Lightweight Angular modular that replicates key design elements of iOS7

Why?
The majority of mobile app that I am asked to build have some sort of cross mobile/web use cases. With AngularJS and increasingly capable mobile devices, it makes sense to build HTML5 apps. So far, my quest for the perfect HTML5 mobile toolkit has not been so good. Most toolkits give me more than I need (more overlappping scripts that I care to load). So I decided to write my own *lightweight* Angular module.

If you need something more feature rich and all encompassing, I recommend that you look into this project: https://github.com/angular-widgets/angular-jqm.

Key Design Goals
1. Designed to be lightweight. My goal is to add "native feel" only to elements that matter the most. For other elements, I just adding at least the CSS of a mainstream front-end toolkit (my favorite is Bootstrap 3). Those design elements are currently limited to:
- Fixed heading
- Page transitions
- List
- List filter
