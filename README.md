angular-ios7
============

Lightweight Angular module that replicates key design elements of iOS7

**Currently under development

<h2>Why?</h2>
To add a native feel to HTML5 apps. So far, my quest for the perfect HTML5 mobile toolkit has been unsuccessful. I use responsive front-end frameworks (like Bootstrap) but they are not designed to achieve that "native feel". Conversely, most mobile specific toolkits give me more than I require -- including overlapping scripts, additional dependencies and conflicting opinions. I do not want any feature that overlaps with Angular (or a responsive framework) unless it provide clear benefits. So I decided to write my own *lightweight* Angular module.

For something more all encompassing, I recommend considering this project: https://github.com/angular-widgets/angular-jqm.

<h2>Goals</h2>
This is a clone of iOS7, not a custom design. iOS is usually my first target platform. To add other platforms or custom look, one could modify only the iOS7 elements in the CSS (without touching JS). 

This project does *not* try to be a complete mobile toolkit. It just clones iOS7 elements key to a native feel. It can be used with a responsive front-end framework without unnecessary overlap and without inherently depending on it. It should remain lightweight and focus only on those key elements. It should not introduce dependencies outside of the Angular ecosystem.

<h2>Features</h2>
Limited to:
- Page
- Fixed heading
- Page transitions
- List
- List filter
- Route provider

This project is largely based on: http://c2prods.com/web/2013/cloning-the-ui-of-ios-7-with-html-css-and-javascript/
