angular-ios7
============

Lightweight Angular module that replicates key design elements of iOS7

<h2>Why?</h2>
To build HTML5 apps with mobile and web use cases. So far, my quest for the perfect HTML5 mobile toolkit has been unsuccessful. I use responsive front-end frameworks (like Bootstrap) but they are not designed to achieve that "native feel". Conversely, most mobile specific toolkits give me more than I need (more overlappping scripts than I care to load). I do not need any feature that overlaps with Angular (or a responsive framework) unless it provide clear benefits. So I decided to write my own *lightweight* Angular module.

For something more all encompassing, I recommend considering this project: https://github.com/angular-widgets/angular-jqm.

<h2>Goals</h2>
This is a clone of iOS7, not a custom design. iOS is usually my first target platform. To add other platforms or custom look, one could modify only the iOS7 elements in the CSS (without touching JS). 

This project does *not* try to be a complete mobile toolkit. It just clones iOS7 elements key to a native feel. It can be used with a responsive front-end framework without unecessary overlaps. It should remain lightweight and focus only on those key elements. It should not require external libraries outside of the Angular ecosystem (no jQuery for example).

<h2>Features</h2>
Limited to:
- Page
- Fixed heading
- Page transitions
- List
- List filter
- Route provider
